# MoviesApp-Test
this is an app created w/ React and TMDB API for the Parrolabs test.

To execute this code you'll need to clone it, In my gitignore I omitted the node_modules, that is why when you clone the repository you'll need to go to the terminal with the address of the directory and execute the following instruction: npm install, so you will download the node_modules that are necessary to execute the project.
In the commit it says "v1.1.0" because there was already an earlier version of the project that was created with React Hooks but now this version is fully created with Class Components and Stateless Functional Components.
The most popular movies that appear on the Home are stored locally in the local storage.
